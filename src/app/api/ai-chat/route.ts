I understand you want to increase your bench press from 120 lbs to 250 lbs. That's an ambitious but achievable goal with the right approach!

### Current Assessment
- Current max: 120 lbs
- Target max: 250 lbs
- This represents a 108% increase in strength

### Realistic Timeline
This type of progression typically takes 12-18 months of consistent training for most lifters, depending on:
- Your training experience
- Your body weight and frame
- Your recovery capacity
- Your consistency

### Key Principles for Bench Press Progress
- **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase weight over time
- **Proper Form**: Technical efficiency is crucial for heavy pressing
- **Frequency**: Bench 2-3 times per week with different intensities
- **Volume Management**: Balance enough volume for growth without overtraining
- **Accessory Work**: Strengthen supporting muscles (triceps, shoulders, upper back)
- **Recovery**: Adequate sleep, nutrition and rest between sessions

### 4-Phase Program

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-6)**
- Bench Press: 3 sets of 8-10 reps at 60-65% of max (70-80 lbs)
- Close-Grip Bench: 3 sets of 8-10 reps
- Dumbbell Incline Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps
- Push-ups: 3 sets to near failure
- Train bench 2x per week with 72 hours between sessions
- Focus: Perfect form, build muscle, establish base

**Phase 2: Hypertrophy (Weeks 7-12)**
- Bench Press: 4 sets of 6-8 reps at 70-75% of max (85-95 lbs)
- Incline Bench: 3 sets of 8-10 reps
- Dumbbell Bench Variations: 3 sets of 8-10 reps
- Tricep Extensions: 3 sets of 10-12 reps
- Train bench 2-3x per week with varied intensity
- Focus: Build muscle mass in chest, shoulders, triceps

**Phase 3: Strength Development (Weeks 13-20)**
- Bench Press: 5 sets of 3-5 reps at 80-85% of current max
- Heavy Close-Grip Bench: 3 sets of 5 reps
- Weighted Dips: 3 sets of 6-8 reps
- Bench Press variation (pause bench, board press): 3 sets of 5 reps
- Train bench 2x per week with one heavy, one moderate day
- Focus: Neural adaptations, force production

**Phase 4: Peak Strength (Weeks 21-24)**
- Bench Press: Work up to heavy singles/doubles at 90%+ of max
- Supplemental Bench: 3 sets of 3 reps at 85%
- Assistance exercises: 2-3 sets of 6-8 reps
- Focus: Maximal strength expression, technique under heavy load

### Nutrition Requirements
- **Protein**: 1.8-2.2g per kg of bodyweight daily
- **Caloric surplus**: 300-500 calories above maintenance if muscle gain is needed
- **Carbohydrates**: Prioritize around training sessions
- **Hydration**: 3-4 liters of water daily minimum

### Recovery Strategies
- 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly
- Active recovery between sessions
- Strategic deload weeks every 4-6 weeks

        responseText = `## Personalized Workout Plan

Based on your goals, here's a balanced workout plan to help you get started:

### 3-Day Full Body Split

**Day 1: Push Focus**
- Barbell Bench Press: 4 sets of 8-10 reps
- Shoulder Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps
- Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps
- Tricep Pushdowns: 3 sets of 12-15 reps
- Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 12-15 reps
- Plank: 3 sets of 30-45 seconds

**Day 2: Pull Focus**
- Pullups or Lat Pulldowns: 4 sets of 8-10 reps
- Barbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps
- Face Pulls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps
- Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 10-12 reps
- Hammer Curls: 3 sets of 10-12 reps
- Russian Twists: 3 sets of 15-20 reps per side

**Day 3: Legs & Core**
- Squats: 4 sets of 8-10 reps
- Romanian Deadlifts: 3 sets of 10-12 reps
- Leg Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps
- Leg Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps
- Calf Raises: 4 sets of 15-20 reps
- Hanging Leg Raises: 3 sets of 10-15 reps

### Guidelines
- Rest 1-2 minutes between sets
- Train 3-4 days per week with at least one rest day between sessions
- Increase weight when you can complete all reps with good form
- Include 5-10 minutes of dynamic stretching before workouts
- Consider adding 20-30 minutes of moderate cardio 2-3 times per week

Would you like me to adjust this plan based on any specific equipment or time constraints you might have?`;

        responseText = `## Personalized Fitness Guidance

Thank you for reaching out! I'd be happy to help you on your fitness journey.

To provide you with the most personalized advice, I'd like to learn more about:

1. **Your current fitness level** (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
2. **Your primary fitness goals** (strength, muscle gain, weight loss, endurance, etc.)
3. **Available equipment** (gym access, home equipment, etc.)
4. **Time available** for training each week
5. **Any limitations or injuries** I should be aware of

This information will help me create tailored recommendations that align with your specific situation.

In the meantime, here are some general fitness principles that apply to most goals:

### Fundamental Fitness Principles
- **Consistency** is more important than intensity
- **Progressive overload** (gradually increasing difficulty) drives improvement
- **Balanced nutrition** should support your activity level
- **Recovery** is when your body actually adapts and improves
- **Proper form** prevents injury and maximizes results

Would you mind sharing more details about your current situation and goals so I can provide more specific guidance?`;
