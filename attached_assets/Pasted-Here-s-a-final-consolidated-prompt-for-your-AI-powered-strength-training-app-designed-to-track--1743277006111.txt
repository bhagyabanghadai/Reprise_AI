Hereâ€™s a **final consolidated prompt** for your AI-powered strength training app, designed to track limits, auto-adjust workouts, and drive progressive overload while prioritizing user safety and engagement:

### **Prompt: Build an AI-Powered Strength Training App**  
**Objective**:  
Create an app that acts as a **24/7 virtual strength coach**, analyzing a userâ€™s lifting limits, logging workouts, and dynamically adjusting their training plan to maximize strength gains while avoiding overtraining.  

---

### **Core Features**  

#### **1. User Onboarding & Limits Setup**  
- **Initial Assessment**:  
  - Ask users to input:  
    - Current 1RMs (or estimate via a "max effort test" protocol).  
    - Training experience (beginner/intermediate/advanced).  
    - Equipment available (barbell, dumbbells, etc.).  
    - Injury history or mobility restrictions.  

#### **2. Dynamic Workout Generation**  
- **Auto-Adjusting Plans**:  
  - Base workouts on the userâ€™s **strength limits** (e.g., 80% of 1RM for working sets).  
  - Example Starting Template:  
    ```  
    Week 1:  
    - Squat: 4x5 @ 80% 1RM  
    - Bench Press: 4x5 @ 80% 1RM  
    - Deadlift: 1x5 @ 85% 1RM  
    ```  
  - **Auto-Progression**:  
    - Add 2.5â€“5 lbs to lifts weekly *if* reps/weight are hit with good form.  
    - Reduce volume (sets/reps) if fatigue or form breakdown is noted.  

#### **3. Daily Logging & AI Analysis**  
- **Log Workouts**:  
  - Users input sets, reps, weight, and notes (e.g., "Felt easy" or "Lower back pain").  
  - **Voice/Barcode Input**: Log via voice commands or scan plates to auto-fill weights.  
- **AI Analysis (Weekly)**:  
  - Track **volume** (sets x reps x weight) and **intensity** (percentage of 1RM).  
  - Adjust next weekâ€™s plan based on:  
    - Missed reps â†’ Lower weight or volume.  
    - Consistent PRs â†’ Increase intensity or add accessory work.  
    - Signs of overtraining â†’ Schedule a deload week.  

#### **4. Adaptive Strength Scaling**  
- **Progressive Overload Automation**:  
  - "You hit 4x5 @ 225 lbs on squats â†’ Next week: 4x5 @ 230 lbs."  
  - "Deadlift stalled at 315 lbs â†’ Add 2x paused reps to improve strength off the floor."  
- **Weak Point Detection**:  
  - "Left arm weaker in rows â†’ Add 3x10 single-arm rows to Fridayâ€™s workout."  

#### **5. Safety & Recovery Monitoring**  
- **Form Checks**:  
  - Use phone camera + AI to analyze squat depth or bench press form (optional).  
- **Deload Protocol**:  
  - Auto-schedule deload weeks every 6â€“8 weeks (e.g., 50% volume).  
  - "Youâ€™ve trained hard for 6 weeks â†’ Next week: 3x3 @ 70% 1RM to recover."  

#### **6. Progress Visualization**  
- **Interactive Graphs**:  
  - Show strength trends (e.g., "Squat 1RM increased by 15% in 3 months").  
  - Track volume per muscle group to prevent imbalances.  
- **PR Celebrations**:  
  - Confetti animation + badge for hitting a new 1RM.  

#### **7. Gamification & Motivation**  
- **Strength Challenges**:  
  - "Beat your previous monthâ€™s volume by 10% to unlock the â€˜Beast Modeâ€™ badge."  
- **Streaks**:  
  - Track consecutive days/weeks of training (ðŸ”¥ streak counter).  

---

### **UI/UX Requirements**  
1. **Quick Log Interface**:  
   - Large buttons for +/- adjustments to weight/reps.  
   - Swipe to navigate between exercises.  
2. **Progress Dashboard**:  
   - At-a-glance graphs showing 1RM trends, volume, and recovery status.  
3. **AI Chatbot**:  
   - Dedicated tab to ask questions like, "Why did I stall on bench press?"  

---

### **Example User Flow**  
1. **Week 1**:  
   - User logs squats: 4x5 @ 225 lbs (hits all reps).  
   - **AI Response**: "Great work! Next week: 4x5 @ 230 lbs."  
2. **Week 3**:  
   - User misses reps on bench press.  
   - **AI Response**: "Reduced to 4x4 @ 185 lbs. Added 2x paused reps for better lockout."  
3. **Week 6**:  
   - AI schedules a deload: "Recharge week! Train at 70% intensity."

### **Final Notes**  
This app will balance **aggressive strength gains** with **smart recovery**, ensuring users stay injury-free while pushing their limits. The AI acts as a coach, not just a tracker, by interpreting data to make **proactive adjustments**.
